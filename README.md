Here's an updated README file tailored to describe your Task List application, focusing on installation and running the application entirely from the backend, which serves both the React frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API.

# Task List Application

This Task List application is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage tasks with attributes such as Title, Description, Status, and Due Date. The application is built with React for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend. The React frontend is served directly by the ASP.NET Core backend, making it a unified application that can be deployed and run from a single server.

## Overview

The Task List Application provides a simple interface to manage tasks. Users can:

- View a list of tasks with the ability to sort by title and due date.
- Create new tasks with details like title, description, status, and due date.
- Edit task details.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Search tasks by title or description.

The backend is powered by ASP.NET Core, which also serves the static files generated by the React frontend. This setup allows the application to run as a single unit.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 6 SDK**: Required to run the ASP.NET Core Web API.
- **Node.js and npm**: Required to build the React frontend.
- **MongoDB or SQL Server**: A database to store task data.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-list-app.git
cd task-list-app
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend (ASP.NET Core)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd TaskManagementApi
    ```

2. **Restore NuGet packages**:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Configure the database**:

    - Open `appsettings.json` and configure the connection strings for MongoDB or SQL Server.
    - Example for MongoDB:

      ```json
      "DatabaseSettings": {
        "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "DatabaseName": "TaskManagementDb",
        "TasksCollectionName": "Tasks"
      }
      ```

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (React)

1. **Navigate to the React directory**:

    ```bash
    cd ../task-management-ui
    ```

2. **Install the npm packages**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the React app**:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Copy the build output** to the ASP.NET Core project:

    - Copy the contents of the `build` directory into the `wwwroot/ClientApp` directory inside the `TaskManagementApi` project.

    ```bash
    cp -r build/* ../TaskManagementApi/wwwroot/ClientApp/
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

    ```bash
    cd TaskManagementApi
    ```

2. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

3. **Access the application**:

    - Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:7093/`.
    - The React frontend will be served from this URL, and all API endpoints are accessible under `/api`.

## API Endpoints

The application provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /api/tasks**: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- **GET /api/tasks/{id}**: Retrieve the details of a specific task.
- **POST /api/tasks**: Create a new task.
- **PUT /api/tasks/{id}**: Update an existing task.
- **DELETE /api/tasks/{id}**: Delete a task.

## Features

- **Task List Overview**: View and sort tasks by title and due date.
- **Task Details Page**: Edit task details and update them in the database.
- **Create New Task**: Add new tasks using a form.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Search Functionality**: Search tasks by title or description.
